## Development Workflow

_For users running on Apple Silicon M1, you may encounter errors thrown by `sharp`. You may need to re-install `libvps` or to build `sharp` manually following [this issue comment](https://github.com/lovell/sharp/issues/2460#issuecomment-751491241) in order to start the project._

## Miscellaneous

### Repository Organization

We chose to use a monorepo design that exploits [Yarn Workspaces](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) in the way [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages) or [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel/tree/master/packages) does. This allows the community to easily maintain the whole ecosystem, keep it up-to-date and consistent.

We do our best to keep the main branch as clean as possible, with tests passing at all times. However, it may happen that the main branch moves faster than the release cycle. Therefore check the [releases on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/leemons) so that you're always up-to-date with the latest stable version.

### Reporting an issue

Before submitting an issue you need to make sure:

- You are experiencing a concrete technical issue with Leemons.
- You have already searched for related [issues](https://github.com/leemonade/leemons/issues), and found none open (if you found a related _closed_ issue, please link to it from your post).
- You are not asking a question about how to use Leemons or about whether or not Leemons has a certain feature. For general help using Leemons, you may:
  - Refer to [the official Leemons documentation](https://leemonade.github.com/leemons-docs).
- Your issue title is concise, on-topic and polite.
- You can and do provide steps to reproduce your issue.
- You have tried all the following (if relevant) and your issue remains:
  - Make sure you have the right application started.
  - Make sure the [issue template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) is respected.
  - Make sure your issue body is readable and [well formatted](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown).
  - Make sure you've killed the Leemons server with CTRL+C and started it again.
  - Make sure the application you are using to reproduce the issue has a clean `node_modules` directory, meaning:
    - no dependencies are linked (e.g. you haven't run `yarn link` nor `npm link`)
    - that you haven't made any inline changes to files in the `node_modules` folder
    - that you don't have any weird global dependency loops. The easiest way to double-check any of the above, if you aren't sure, is to run: `$ rm -rf node_modules && yarn cache clear && yarn install`.
