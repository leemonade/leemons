Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Duplicates a specific task\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for duplicating an existing task identified by its unique ID. It copies the task details and creates a new task with the same attributes but a new identifier.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be logged in to duplicate a task. Requests without valid authentication will be rejected.\\n\\n**Permissions:** A user needs to have edit or create permissions on tasks to perform duplication. Without the necessary permissions, the endpoint will deny access to the task duplication functionality.\\n\\nThe controller initiates the duplication process by calling the `duplicate` function from the `task` core module. It receives the task ID to be duplicated from the request parameters. The `duplicate` function internally handles the task of fetching the existing task data, cloning its details while generating a new task ID, and saving the new task entry in the database. It ensures that all linked items, such as subtasks and attachments, are also duplicated appropriately. Once the duplication is complete, the new task details are returned in the response, signalling successful operation.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
