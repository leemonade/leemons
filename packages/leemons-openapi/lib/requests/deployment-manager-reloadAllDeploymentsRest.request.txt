  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'reloadAllDeploymentsRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-deployment-manager/backend/services/rest/deployment-manager.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Reload all deployment configurations\",\"description\":\"This endpoint reloads all the deployment configurations from the storage, ensuring that any updates or changes in the deployment settings are immediately reflected across the system. This is crucial for maintaining consistency and up-to-date operation parameters in dynamic environments.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Access to this endpoint requires the user to be authenticated. Without valid authentication, the system will deny access to this service.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users must have administrative permissions specifically for deployment management. Access without sufficient permissions will result in a denial of service error.\\n\\nThe handler initiates by fetching all deployment configurations using the `getAllDeployments` method. This method interacts with the underlying database or file system to retrieve updated configurations. Upon successful retrieval, the system iterates through each deployment configuration to apply necessary updates or reinitializations as needed. This comprehensive refresh ensures that any subsystem or service relying on these configurations is synchronized with the latest deployment settings. The response concludes with a confirmation message indicating successful reload or an error message detailing any issues encountered during the process.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
