  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'removeConfigEventRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-calendar/backend/services/rest/calendar.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Remove a specific calendar configuration event\",\"description\":\"This endpoint handles the deletion of a specific event from a calendar configuration. The event to be deleted is identified by its unique event ID, which must be provided as part of the request. The operation ensures that the specified event is properly removed from the system's calendar configuration, maintaining the integrity of the remaining calendar events.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated and possess a valid session token to access this endpoint. Unauthorized access attempts will be logged and denied.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user needs to have administrative rights or specific permissions on the calendar module to perform event deletions. Lack of appropriate permissions will result in an access denial response.\\n\\nUpon receiving the request, the server invokes the `removeEvent` method from the `CalendarConfigs` core. This method takes the event ID from the request parameters and performs a query to locate the event within the database. If the event is found, it proceeds with the deletion process, which involves removing the event record and ensuring that any references to this event in other parts of the application are also updated or removed as necessary. The method concludes by returning a success message if the deletion is successful, or an error message detailing why the deletion could not be completed.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
