  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'putKnowledgeRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio/backend/services/rest/knowledge.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Updates the specified knowledge area\",\"description\":\"This endpoint updates an existing knowledge area within the academic portfolio system. It is used to modify specific details about a knowledge area, such as its title or description, ensuring that the academic portfolio remains current and accurate.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to access this endpoint. An authenticated session must be established, and valid credentials must be provided in the request.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This endpoint requires administrative permissions related to academic portfolio management. Users must have permissions to update knowledge areas to execute this operation successfully.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint initially verifies user credentials and permissions to ensure legitimacy and authority over the requested operations. It then proceeds to call the `updateKnowledgeArea` method located in the 'knowledges' core module. This method handles the business logic necessary to securely update details of the knowledge area in the database. The workflow includes validation of the incoming data against predefined schemas, checking for existing knowledge area records, and applying updates where applicable. Finally, the response confirms the successful update of the knowledge area, returning details about the updated entity or an error message if the update fails.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
