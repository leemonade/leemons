Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It allows for modifications of settings and parameters that determine how deployments are handled for that project.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to modify deployment configurations. Authentication ensures that requests are made by legitimate users of the application.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need specific permissions related to deployment management. Typically, this includes administrative rights or specific role-based permissions that allow a user to modify deployment settings.\\n\\nThe endpoint processes the incoming request by first validating the user's credentials and permissions. If authentication or permission checks fail, the request is denied. Upon successful validation, the endpoint invokes the `updateDeploymentConfig` method from the `deployments` core. This method is responsible for updating the deployment configuration based on the provided parameters in the request body. It handles various checks and balances to ensure that the new configuration does not conflict with existing deployment rules and standards. Once updated, the function confirms the changes and responds back with a status indicating the successful update of the deployment configuration.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
