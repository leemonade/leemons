Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It identifies the primary language and regional settings that are used across various functionalities where localized content is required.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users do not need to be logged in to access the default locale. It is publicly accessible to provide a consistent user experience in terms of language and region right from the start of interaction with the platform.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are required to access this endpoint. It serves general platform information which is intended to be freely accessible to all users, ensuring that localization preferences can be resolved and applied even before user authentication.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the `getDefaultLocaleRest` action invokes the `getDefaultLocale` method from the platform core services. This method directly reads the locale configuration from the system settings, generally maintained in a configuration file or a database. The output of this method is the default locale setting such as 'en-US' or 'fr-FR', which is then returned to the requester in JSON format, ensuring that the client application can adjust its language and regional settings accordingly.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
