  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'postRuleProcessRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-grades/backend/services/rest/rules.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Processes grading rules based on user actions\",\"description\":\"This endpoint processes specific grading rules applicable to a user based on their actions within the platform. Depending on the conditions set up for each rule, this might include calculating grades, sending notifications, or adjusting user status.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to ensure that the rule processing is applied to the correct user account. Actions conducted without proper authentication will not be processed.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need to have sufficient permissions typically related to educational or administrative roles, for this endpoint to process grading rules on their behalf. Lack of required permissions will result in denial of service for the requested action.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint initially validates the userâ€™s authentication status and permissions. It then uses a series of service calls including `processRulesForUserAgent`, `getRuleConditionsByRuleIds`, `getConditionsByRule`, and `getConditionGroupsByRule` to fetch relevant rules and conditions. These functions collectively determine which rules are applicable based on the user's recent activities or input data. Once applicable rules are identified, the endpoint executes these rules, potentially updating grades, triggering notifications, or modifying user-related data based on the outcomes of the rule processes. Finally, the results of the rule processing are compiled and sent back as a response to the user in a structured format.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
