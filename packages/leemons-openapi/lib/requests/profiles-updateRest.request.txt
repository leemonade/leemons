  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'updateRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-users/backend/services/rest/profiles.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Updates user profile details\",\"description\":\"This endpoint allows for the updating of user profile details based on the provided profile information. The update can include changes in name, roles, and other specific profile attributes that are supported by the system.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to update a profile. The endpoint validates the provided session or authentication token to ensure the request is made by a registered and logged-in user.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The executing user must have admin privileges or specific permission to update user profiles. Any attempt to update a profile without the required permissions will lead to a permission denial error.\\n\\nUpon receiving the update request, the handler first verifies user authentication and checks if the logged-in user has the necessary permissions. It calls the `existName` method to check if the provided new profile name already exists, ensuring uniqueness of profile names in the system. The `update` function is then executed from 'profiles/index.js', with parameters gathered from the request body, to apply the updates in the user database. This process involves interaction with several services to correctly update all elements related to the user profile, including roles and permissions. The success or failure of the operation, along with the updated profile details, is then sent back to the user in the form of a JSON response.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
