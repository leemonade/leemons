  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'canRemoveGradeScaleRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-grades/backend/services/rest/gradeScales.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Determine if a grade scale can be safely removed\",\"description\":\"This endpoint checks if a specified grade scale can be removed from the system without disrupting any associated data. It evaluates dependencies such as conditions, tags, and grades linked to the grade scale to ensure no active references could lead to data integrity issues if the scale were deleted.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to perform this check. Access without proper authentication will prevent the endpoint from executing.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users must have administrative or specific grade management permissions to verify the removability of a grade scale.\\n\\nThe handler begins by calling the `canRemoveGradeScale` method within the `grade-scales` core module. This method checks associated records in other tables like conditions, tags, and grades that might be using the grade scale. It consolidates this information to determine whether the scale is currently in use or if it can be freely removed. If no dependencies are found, the method returns a positive response, allowing for the safe deletion of the grade scale. This information is then formatted into a JSON response indicating whether removing the grade scale is feasible or not.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
