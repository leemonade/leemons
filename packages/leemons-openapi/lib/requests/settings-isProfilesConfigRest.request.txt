  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'isProfilesConfigRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio/backend/services/rest/settings.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Check if user profile settings are configured\",\"description\":\"This endpoint examines the system's configuration to determine if the profile settings for a user have been correctly set up and configured. It primarily checks the presence and validity of certain user-specific configurations which are essential for further operations and access within the academic portfolio plugin.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to check their profile configuration status. Any request without a valid session or authentication token will be rejected.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This action requires administrator-level permissions, as it involves accessing sensitive configuration data that could influence the accessibility and functionality of user profiles across the platform.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the handler initiates by calling the `isProfilesConfig` method from the Settings core. This method assesses whether the user profiles have all necessary configurations set based on predefined criteria stored within the system. It checks various configuration parameters and ensures they align with the required standards for a proper operational environment. The method returns a boolean indicating the existence and correctness of these configurations. The response communicated back to the client provides clear information on the configuration status, facilitating further user or admin actions based on the outcome.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
