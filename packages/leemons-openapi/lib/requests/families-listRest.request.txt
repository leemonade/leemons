  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'listRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-families/backend/services/rest/families.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It consolidates data from various sources and presents a unified view to simplify user interactions with family records.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to ensure secure access to the family data. Only authorized users can retrieve the list based on their credentials.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must possess the appropriate permissions to view family entities. These permissions help in enforcing data security and access rights specific to user roles within the application.\\n\\nFollowing authentication and permission checks, the `listRest` controller in the family plugin initializes by calling the `list` method located in `families/index.js`. This method further interacts with underlying service layers to fetch and organize data pertinent to the families. The retrieval process takes into consideration the user's role and permissions to filter and return only those family records that the user is authorized to view. The final output is formatted and sent back as JSON data, which includes details of each family entity accessible to the user.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
