  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'listRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-users/backend/services/rest/permissions.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"List all permissions available in the system\",\"description\":\"This endpoint provides a comprehensive listing of all permissions that a user or system can be granted within the platform. It is primarily used to fetch a structured list of permissions, which helps in managing and assigning user roles and rights effectively.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User must be logged into the system to access this endpoint. Unauthorized access attempts will be rejected, ensuring that only authenticated users can retrieve permission information.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have administrative rights or an equivalent level of permissions specifically allowing them to view all permissions. This is critical to ensure that only authorized personnel manage and view sensitive permission data.\\n\\nFrom the outset, the `listRest` handler function activates the core method from the `permissions` module, particularly targeting the `list.js` file. This method systematically gathers all permissions defined across the platform. It encapsulates both default and dynamically added permissions into a structured response. Each permission is associated with its respective module, allowing for easy identification and management. The endpoint processes this data, and the result is returned as a JSON object listing all permissions, which can then be utilized for further administrative tasks or audits.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
