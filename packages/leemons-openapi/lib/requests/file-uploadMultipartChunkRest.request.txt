  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'uploadMultipartChunkRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-leebrary/backend/services/rest/files.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Handle chunked file uploads for large files\",\"description\":\"This endpoint facilitates the upload of large files in multiple chunks. It is specifically designed to handle cases where a file needs to be uploaded in segments to manage the load and ensure efficient data transfer over the network.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to perform file uploads. The endpoint verifies the identity of the uploader and ensures that a valid session exists before processing any uploaded content.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need to have the 'upload_file_chunk' permission. This ensures that only authorized users can initiate and continue chunked uploads, maintaining the security and integrity of the file-handling process.\\n\\nInitially, the endpoint invokes the `uploadMultipartChunk` method from the `Files` service. This method manages the reception of each file chunk, validating its part number and merging it with previous chunks if needed. It uses the `createTemp` function to temporarily store incoming chunks, while the `isReadableStream` checks if the incoming data stream is readable and not corrupted. Once all chunks have been received and verified, the `streamToBuffer` function compiles the chunks into a single file. An acknowledgment of successful upload or an error response detailing any issues during the process is then sent back to the client.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
