Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It effectively removes the entry from the database that matches the provided knowledge area identifier.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to access this endpoint, ensuring that only authenticated users can initiate deletion processes.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have administrative rights or the specific permission to alter knowledge area data. This ensures that only authorized personnel can delete knowledge areas from the system.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint first verifies the authenticity of the user and checks if the user has the necessary permissions to proceed. It then invokes the `removeKnowledgeArea` core method, passing the identifier of the knowledge area to be deleted. This method interacts with the database to locate and remove the specified knowledge area. If the operation is successful, it returns a confirmation response to the user indicating that the knowledge area has been successfully deleted. Any issues during the process, such as database errors or permission denials, are handled appropriately and communicated back to the user through the response.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
