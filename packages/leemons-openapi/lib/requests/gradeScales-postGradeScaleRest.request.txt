  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'postGradeScaleRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-grades/backend/services/rest/gradeScales.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Add a new grade scale\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for adding a new grade scale to the system. It handles the creation of a scalable metric system that can be used for evaluating student performance within the platform. The function of this endpoint is to receive grade scale details and incorporate them into the system's existing educational framework.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to submit new grade scales. The system verifies the user's credentials and session tokens to ensure legitimacy before proceeding with the request.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need to have specific administrative rights typically reserved for educational staff or system administrators. The required permissions involve managing or altering grade scales, which is a critical aspect of the educational settings control.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the `postGradeScaleRest` handler first validates the incoming data using predefined validation schemas located in the `forms.js`. If validation passes, it proceeds to call the `addGradeScale` method from the `grade-scales` core module. This method takes the validated data and adds a new grade scale to the database, ensuring that all necessary attributes are duly processed and stored. The operation may involve transactional controls to guarantee data integrity before finally responding to the user with the outcome of the operation, either successful addition or error details.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
