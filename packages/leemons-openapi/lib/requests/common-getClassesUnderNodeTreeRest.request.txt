  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'getClassesUnderNodeTreeRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio/backend/services/rest/common.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Retrieve classes under a specific node tree\",\"description\":\"This endpoint fetches all class details located under a specified node tree hierarchy within the academic system. It processes the node tree structure and lists all classes linked under the nodes encompassed by the specified root node.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory to access this endpoint. Users without a valid session or authentication token will be denied access.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Necessary permissions include access to the academic program data. Users must have roles that grant visibility or management of class information under the specified node hierarchy.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, this endpoint initiates by calling the `getClassesUnderNodeTree` function from the `Common` core module, submitting the node ID and leveraging a recursive search to trace through the node tree hierarchy. The operation accesses interconnected nodes and aggregates classes belonging to each node. The action leverages database queries to fetch and compile lists of classes, ensuring the returning data is constructed accurately based on user permissions and authenticated session. The endpoint concludes by packaging this list into a JSON response format, providing a consolidated view of class data structured under the queried node tree.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
