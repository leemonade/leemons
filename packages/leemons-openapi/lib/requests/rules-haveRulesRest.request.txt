  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'haveRulesRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-grades/backend/services/rest/rules.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Checks the applicability of grading rules for a specific context\",\"description\":\"This endpoint assesses the application of defined grading rules within a given educational or testing scenario. It verifies whether certain grading criteria are met and determines the applicability of rules based on the context provided in the request.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to ensure that only authorized personnel can check and apply grading rules. An attempt to access this endpoint without a valid authentication token will result in denial of access.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This endpoint requires the user to have permissions to manage or view grading settings within the platform. Users without sufficient permissions will not be able to execute or view the results of this rule check.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint first validates user authentication and permissions. If these checks pass, it then proceeds to invoke the `haveRules` method from the `rules` core. This method analyzes the context provided — such as academic level, department, or specific test details — and retrieves all applicable grading rules from the database. It evaluates these rules to determine if they are applicable to the provided scenario, using a set of predefined logic criteria. The result of this process is a decision on whether the rules can be applied, along with any necessary details explaining the reasoning. This response is then serialized into JSON format and sent back to the requester, providing clear information on rule applicability.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
