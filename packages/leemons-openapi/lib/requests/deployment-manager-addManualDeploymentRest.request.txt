Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It primarily serves as the starting point for deploying new configurations or services manually by the user.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to initiate a deployment process. Unauthorized access will be blocked and the system will only process requests from valid, logged-in users.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have specific roles or permissions, typically like 'deployment-manager' or 'admin', allowing them to perform deployment-related actions within the system.\\n\\nThe process starts with the endpoint receiving a deployment configuration request. This request triggers the `addDeployment` method in the deployment manager's core logic. The method involves validating the provided deployment data against predefined schemas and ensuring all necessary components for the deployment are accounted for and correctly configured. Following the validation, the deployment data is saved to the system's database. Successful execution results in a response indicating the deployment has been initiated, along with details of the deployment record.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
