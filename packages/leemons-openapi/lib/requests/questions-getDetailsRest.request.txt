Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

The operation is meant to gather detailed data including text, options, and expected answers for these questions, which could be used for assessments or information display purposes.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated in order to access question details. Unauthenticated requests will be denied access to this endpoint.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The endpoint requires users to have the 'view_questions' permission to ensure that only authorized users can fetch question details. Additional checks may be done against each question ID to verify that the user has access to the specific information.\\n\\nThe endpoint internally calls the `getByIds` method provided by the questions core API. This method takes an array of question IDs from the request and executes a query to retrieve their details from the database. Each question's data is then processed to include necessary information such as question text, choices, correct answers, and any additional metadata. The response from the API encapsulates this data in a structured format, responding back to the client with the requested question details in JSON.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
