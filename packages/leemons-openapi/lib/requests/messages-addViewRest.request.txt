  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'addViewRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-board-messages/backend/services/rest/messages.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Increment view count for a specific message\",\"description\":\"This endpoint increments the view count of a specific message on the board. The operation counts each view from users to provide insights into the popularity and engagement level of the message.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to track the views adequately and ensure that views are counted accurately for each user. A valid user session is necessary to perform this operation.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need to have 'read' permission for the specific message to increment its view count. Attempting to access the endpoint without appropriate permissions will result in access denial.\\n\\nInitially, the endpoint validates the user's authentication status and checks if the user has 'read' permission for the message in question. Upon successful validation, it calls the `addView` method from the `Messages` core, passing the message's unique identifier. This method updates the view count in the database. The flow ensures that each view is logged only once per user session, using session management techniques to prevent duplicate counts. The updated view count data is then committed to the database, ensuring consistency and accuracy throughout the process.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
