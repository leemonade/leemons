  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'getManyRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-assignables/backend/services/rest/assignations.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Fetches multiple assignations based on specified criteria\",\"description\":\"This endpoint fetches a list of assignations based on various filtering, sorting, and pagination parameters. It is intended to provide a comprehensive overview of assignations that meet specified criteria, aiding in efficient data management and retrieval within the application.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to request the assignation data. Authentication tokens must be provided as part of the request headers to verify user identity and session validity.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Proper permissions are required to access this endpoint. Users need to have roles or rights specifically granting them access to view assignations. Failure to meet these permission checks will result in access being denied.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the `getManyRest` handler initiates a process to validate user authentication and authorization. Post validation, it employs a series of methods to apply filters, execute sorting mechanisms, and handle pagination details. The final data retrieval involves querying the database with the formulated conditions to compile a list of assignations that match the provided parameters. The result set is then formatted and delivered as a structured JSON response, providing the client with the requested data on assignations.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
