  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'updateEventRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-calendar/backend/services/rest/calendar.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Update an existing event's details\",\"description\":\"This endpoint allows for the modification of an existing event's details based on the provided event identifier. It adjusts the properties like the event's name, duration, and any associated metadata. The update process ensures that only valid and permitted changes are applied to the event.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users are required to be authenticated in order to perform an update operation on an event. Unauthenticated requests will be rejected.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have edit permissions for the particular event they attempt to update. If the user lacks the necessary permissions, the request will be denied and an error message returned.\\n\\nThe endpoint begins by validating the user's authentication status and permissions for the event specified in the request. Upon successful authentication and authorization, it calls the `update` method located in the `Events` core module, passing necessary parameters like the event ID and the new data to be updated. This method handles the logic of verifying which pieces of event information can be updated, ensuring data integrity and adherence to any constraints set within the application's business rules. Once updates are applied, it saves the changes to the database and returns an acknowledgment response to the client that the event was successfully updated.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
