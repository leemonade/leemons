  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'programHasCoursesRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio/backend/services/rest/programs.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Checks if a program includes certain courses\",\"description\":\"This endpoint determines if a specified academic program includes one or more specific courses. It is typically used to verify program curriculum completeness or to assist in academic planning and advising.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to access this endpoint. Unauthorized access attempts will be blocked and logged.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This function requires the user to have 'view_program_courses' permission. Without the necessary permissions, access to the data will be denied, and only a generic error message will be returned to the user.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the handler first authenticates the user and checks for the necessary permissions. If validation fails at any point, the process is terminated, and an appropriate error message is returned. If the checks are successful, the handler invokes the `getProgramCourses` method from the `programs` core module, passing the program's identification details. This method accesses the database to retrieve a list of courses associated with the specified program; it performs this by querying the program-course relationship data. Once the data is obtained and processed, the handler constructs a response containing information about whether the required courses are part of the program, then sends this response to the requester.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
