  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'programHasSubstagesRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio/backend/services/rest/programs.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Determine if a program contains any substages\",\"description\":\"This endpoint checks if a specific academic program contains any substages or not. The primary operation of this endpoint is to ascertain the substage structure within a particular program, which is crucial for managing educational program layouts.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory to access this endpoint. Users must provide valid session credentials to proceed with querying the academic program substages.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Appropriate permissions are required to access this endpoint. Users should possess the 'view_programs' permission or similar rights that allow them to interact with academic program data.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the handler `programHasSubstagesRest` calls the `getProgramSubstages` method in the `programs` core. This method fetches the program details based on the provided program ID and evaluates whether there are any associated substages. The flow includes validating the userâ€™s credentials and permissions, retrieving the program data from the database, and analyzing the presence of substages. The result, indicating either the existence or absence of substages, is then returned as a Boolean value to the client.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
