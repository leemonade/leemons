  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'statusRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-bulk-data/backend/services/rest/bulk.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Check bulk data processing status\",\"description\":\"This endpoint checks the current status of a bulk data processing task. It allows users to monitor the progress of data uploads or other asynchronous bulk operations they have initiated.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to track the progress of their own bulk data processing tasks. If unauthenticated, the endpoint will restrict access.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This endpoint requires users to have 'bulk_data_view' permission to check the status of bulk data processing tasks. Access without the appropriate permissions will result in a denial of service.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint uses the `checkStatus` method in the BulkDataService. This method queries the database to retrieve the current status and details of the requested bulk data processing task. The query filters tasks based on the user's session information to ensure that users can only access data related to their tasks. The response includes detailed information about the task's progression, such as the percentage completed, any errors encountered, and the expected time of completion. The output is formatted as a JSON object and returned to the user, providing a clear and informative status update.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
