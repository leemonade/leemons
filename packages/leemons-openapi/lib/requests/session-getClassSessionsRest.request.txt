  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'getClassSessionsRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-attendance-control/backend/services/rest/session.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It handles the task of mapping out all class sessions that fall within the given date range and according to the pre-defined class schedules in the system.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to request the session information. Without proper authentication, the endpoint will deny access to the data.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This endpoint requires the user to have 'view_sessions' permission. Users lacking this permission will not be able to retrieve any session data.\\n\\nThe controller begins by invoking the `calculeSessionsBetweenDatesFromSchedule` method from the `Sessions` core, which takes in parameters for start and end dates, along with the schedule identifiers. This method computes all possible session occurrences within the provided dates and aligns them based on the class schedules. Once this calculation is complete, the result - a list of session times and details - is formatted and sent back through the response in JSON format, encompassing all sessions applicable within the specified date range.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
