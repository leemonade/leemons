Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

The functionality encapsulates user engagement by allowing feedback submissions to be directly attached to specific targets identified within the system.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to submit feedback. The system checks for a valid session or token before processing the request.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have the 'submit_feedback' permission to perform this action. Access without sufficient permissions will result in a denial of service error.\\n\\nThe process initiates with the `assignFeedback` method in the feedback core service. This method receives information about the feedback such as the target ID and the feedback details. It performs validation checks to ensure data integrity and compliance with established standards. Subsequently, the method interacts with the database backend to record the submitted feedback against the specified target, ensuring that all referencing and data relationships are properly maintained. The completion of the operation results in a confirmation response that the feedback has been successfully assigned, including any relevant metadata related to the assignment.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
