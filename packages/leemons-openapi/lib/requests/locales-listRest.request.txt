  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'listRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-multilanguage/backend/services/rest/locales.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It enables clients to retrieve a full array of locale identifiers which are necessary for managing translations and localizations within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to access this list. The endpoint ensures that only authorized users can access language settings, maintaining a secure environment for managing sensitive locale data.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users must possess 'view_locales' permission to access this endpoint. This requirement ensures that only users with adequate privileges can view and manage locales, aligning with the system's security protocols for sensitive data access.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the `listRest` handler initiates the process by invoking the `listLocales` method in the core locale management module. This method queries the system's internal database to fetch all active locales. The retrieved data is then formatted appropriately before being sent back to the client. The response includes a structured list of locale identifiers, each associated with its specific language and regional details, formatted as a JSON array. The completion of this method concludes the request-response cycle for this specific endpoint.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
