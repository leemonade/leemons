  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'setQuestionResponseRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-tests/backend/services/rest/tests.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Stores a userâ€™s response to a specific test question\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for recording a user's response to a given question in a test scenario. It ensures that the response is saved in the appropriate format and associated with the correct user and test instance.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to ensure that responses are recorded for the correct user. An absence of valid authentication will prevent the endpoint from processing the request.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Specific permissions related to test-taking capabilities are required for a user to submit their responses. The exact permissions should be defined based on the level of access the user has to the test and the type of questions they are allowed to answer.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, this endpoint invokes the `setQuestionResponse` method within the `Tests` service. This method processes the input, which includes the user's ID, the test ID, the question ID, and the user's response. The method verifies the validity of the data and checks against user permissions. Once validated, the response is stored in a database with the necessary metadata such as timestamp and user details. The process is designed to ensure data integrity and security, providing a reliable way for users to submit their test responses.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
