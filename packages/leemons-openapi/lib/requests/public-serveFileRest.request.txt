  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'serveFileRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-scorm/backend/services/rest/public.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Serve SCORM content securely\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for securely delivering SCORM packages to authenticated users. The service ensures that only approved users can access the specific SCORM content, providing a vital layer in content security and compliance with eLearning standards.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is crucial for this endpoint. Users must provide valid credentials to access SCORM content. The service validates these credentials before serving any content, rejecting access attempts with invalid authentication tokens.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The access to SCORM content is tightly controlled. Users need specific permissions related to eLearning course access, which are verified during the request handling. Lack of adequate permissions results in access being denied.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the `serveFileRest` handler first checks the user's authentication status and permissions associated with the SCORM content being requested. It utilizes methods such as `verifyUserAuth` and `checkPermissions` to ensure that these criteria are met. If the user is authenticated and has the necessary permissions, the method then proceeds to fetch the requested SCORM file from the server's secure storage using the `getSCORMFile` method. This process involves accessing the filesystem securely to retrieve and serve the content to the user. The response includes the SCORM package data, delivered in a manner that adheres to HTTP and content security protocols.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
