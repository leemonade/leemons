Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It allows for the removal of specified center data if the prerequisites are met, ensuring data integrity and compliance with system rules.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User must be authenticated to access this endpoint. Without a valid session or authentication credentials, the request will be rejected.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have admin-level permissions to remove a center. Specific rights to modify or delete center information are required to execute this operation.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, this handler calls the `remove` method in the `/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-users/backend/core/centers/remove.js` core file. This method checks if the center exists and verifies the user has the necessary permissions. If all conditions are met, the center is removed from the database. The process involves several checks to ensure the integrity of the operation, handling errors gracefully and reverting changes if necessary to maintain system consistency. Finally, a success response is returned, indicating that the center has been successfully removed.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
