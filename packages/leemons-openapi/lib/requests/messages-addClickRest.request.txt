  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'addClickRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-board-messages/backend/services/rest/messages.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Logs a new view or interaction with a specific message\",\"description\":\"This endpoint tracks user interactions with a message by logging each click or view event. It is designed to help in analyzing how messages are interacted with by users, allowing for improved message engagement and content refinements over time.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be logged in to log interactions with messages. This ensures that each interaction can be attributed to a specific user, enhancing the accuracy of the interaction data.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users must have 'view' permissions on the board where the message is posted to interact with messages. If a user does not possess the required permissions, their interaction will not be logged, and they will receive an unauthorized access error.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the 'addClickRest' handler invokes the `addClick` method from the `messages` core module. This method takes parameters identifying the message and the user who interacted with it. It records each interaction as a click or view event in the database, tagging it with the user's ID and timestamp. The process ensures that all interactions are accurately logged and available for reporting and analytics. The response from this method confirms the successful logging of the interaction, returning a success status to the user.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
