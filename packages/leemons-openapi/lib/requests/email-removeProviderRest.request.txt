Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

The removal process is handled securely and ensures that all related data is also cleaned up properly.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to perform this operation. A valid session token must be provided as part of the request headers to authorize the deletion operation.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Administrative permissions are required to access this endpoint. Users must have the 'email.admin' role assigned to successfully execute this action.\\n\\nUpon receiving the request, the handler first verifies that the provided session token corresponds to a user with the necessary administrative permissions. It then invokes the `removeProvider` method from the `EmailService`. This method locates the specific email provider configuration based on an identifier provided in the request and proceeds with its deletion from the database. Throughout this process, appropriate error handling mechanisms are in place to manage issues like non-existent identifiers or database errors, ensuring the response accurately reflects the outcome of the operation.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
