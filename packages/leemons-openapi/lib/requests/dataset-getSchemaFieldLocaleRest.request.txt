  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'getSchemaFieldLocaleRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-dataset/backend/services/rest/dataset.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Fetches localized schema details for a specific field in a dataset.\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for retrieving the localized details of a specific schema field within a dataset. The localized details indicate variations or specifics such as localized labels or descriptions, according to different set locales which can support applications in providing multi-lingual features.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the localized schema information. Absence of proper authentication will restrict access to the endpoint.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need to have adequate permissions related to viewing or managing dataset schemas to access this endpoint. This might include roles such as admin, editor, or specific roles granted access to the dataset management module.\\n\\nThe endpoint initiates by validating the user's authentication status and permissions. It then proceeds to call the `getSchemaFieldLocale` method from the dataset schema core services. This method accepts parameters such as `fieldId` and `locale`, and conducts a database query to fetch the corresponding localized data for the specified schema field. The result of this query is processed and returned as JSON, containing detailed localized information of the schema field, which supports front-end applications in rendering context-appropriate label or description based on userâ€™s locale setting.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
