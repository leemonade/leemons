  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'existsRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-leebrary/backend/services/rest/categories.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Check category existence\",\"description\":\"This endpoint checks whether a specific category exists within the leemons-plugin-leebrary system. It is typically used to validate category inputs in various operations throughout the plugin's features.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The endpoint requires that users be authenticated. Failure to provide a valid authentication token will prevent access to the endpoint functionalities.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need specific permissions related to category management to access this endpoint. The necessary permissions ensure that only authorized users can check for the existence of categories, maintaining system integrity and security.\\n\\nThe operation begins with the `exists` action within the `categories.rest.js` service file that calls the `exists` method from the `/backend/core/categories/exists` module. This method takes a category ID from the request parameters and checks the database for the presence of this category. The logic verifies the existence of the category using the unique identifiers provided. The final outcome of this operation is a Boolean value (true or false), which indicates whether the category is present in the database. This result is then sent back to the client as a simple JSON response indicating the existence status.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
