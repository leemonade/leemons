  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'getOverlapsRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-board-messages/backend/services/rest/messages.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Identify overlapping board message configurations\",\"description\":\"This endpoint checks for overlapping configurations in board messages. It is primarily used to prevent the scheduling of messages that may conflict with existing board configurations, ensuring clear and non-overlapping communication channels across various boards.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to access this functionality. Authentication verifies user identity and ensures that actions performed are attributed to a specific and authorized user.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Appropriate permissions are required to access this endpoint. Users must have administrative or appropriate roles that grant them access to configure or manage board messages and their underlying settings.\\n\\nThe endpoint initiates by calling the `getOverlapsWithOtherConfigurations` method from the `messages` module. This method attempts to analyze the incoming configuration against the database records of other configurations to identify any overlaps. It sorts these configurations based on pre-established criteria to prioritize newer timestamps or critical configurations. After processing, the method returns detailed information about any overlaps found, which includes data such as timestamps, affected message IDs, and the specifics of the overlap. This data is then passed back through the response payload in JSON format, providing comprehensive insights to the requester about any potential conflicts in board message scheduling.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
