  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'deleteTestRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-tests/backend/services/rest/tests.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

The deletion process permanently removes the test from the system, including all associated data.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to ensure that only authorized users can delete tests. A verification process checks whether the provided user credentials match with an existing user session.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have 'delete_tests' permission to execute this action. If the user lacks this permission, the request is denied with an appropriate error message.\\n\\nUpon receiving the delete request, the `deleteTest` action in the `tests.rest.js` file gets triggered. This action starts by verifying the user's authentication status and permissions. If authentication or permissions checks fail, it immediately returns a response indicating the lack of authorization. If checks pass, the action calls the `deleteTestById` method from the `tests` core module. This method executes a database query to remove the test based on the provided ID. The completion of this operation models the final response where the success or failure of the deletion is communicated back to the client.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
