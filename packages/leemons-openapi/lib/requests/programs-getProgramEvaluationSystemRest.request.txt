  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'getProgramEvaluationSystemRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio/backend/services/rest/programs.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

The focus is on providing detailed settings pertaining to how program performances are assessed, including grading schemes and evaluation procedures.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is a prerequisite for accessing this information. An absence of proper authentication will prevent access to the endpoint.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This endpoint requires that the user has administrative rights within the academic program. Specific permission checks include verifying user roles such as administrator or faculty member before proceeding.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, this handler invokes the `getProgramEvaluationSystem` method from the `programs` core module. This method performs a query to fetch the evaluation system details from the program's data storage by leveraging the program identifier provided in the request. The comprehensive flow from request to response ensures that only authorized and authenticated users can access precise and relevant evaluation system data, adhered to predetermined permission protocols. The successful completion of the query resolves in transmitting the evaluation system data back to the requester through a meticulously structured JSON response.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
