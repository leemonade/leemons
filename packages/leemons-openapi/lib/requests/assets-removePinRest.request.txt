  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'removePinRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-leebrary/backend/services/rest/assets.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Remove a pinned asset from the user's collection\",\"description\":\"This endpoint allows a user to unpin or remove an asset previously marked as important or distinctive in their collection. The function alters the user's pinned asset list by removing a specified asset, thus updating the user's preferences and collection views.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory to ensure that the request to unpin an asset originates from a bona fide source. An invalid or expired authentication token will prevent access to this functionality.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This endpoint requires that users have proper rights to modify their own pinned assets. The specific permission `unpin_asset` should be validated to permit the operation which ensures the integrity and security of user data.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the `removePinRest` endpoint first verifies user authentication and permissions. It then proceeds to call the `unpinAsset` method within the service logic where the actual unpinning procedure is executed. This method checks the provided asset identifier against the userâ€™s currently pinned assets, and if found, it is removed from the pinned list. The entire process is encapsulated within a transaction to ensure data consistency. Should the operation succeed, a success response is sent back to the user; in case of failure due to reasons such as non-existent asset ID or insufficient permissions, the appropriate error message is returned.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
