  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'instanceCreateRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-tasks/backend/services/rest/assignments.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Create a new assignment instance\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for creating a new assignment instance within a specific course or educational context. It handles the instantiation of assignments based on predefined templates or configurations and assigns them to the intended participants or groups.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to create new assignment instances. Access is denied if the user's credentials are not verified.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have 'create_assignment' permission within their role to execute this action. Access without sufficient permissions will result in an authorization error.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the `instanceCreateRest` handler first validates the provided input parameters to ensure they meet the necessary schema and logic requirements. It then interacts with the 'Assignments' module to initiate the creation process. The logic includes determining the target group or participants, applying any specific configurations (such as deadlines or unique instructions), and saving the new instance into the system's database. This process might also trigger notifications to inform participants about the new assignment. Once successfully created, the endpoint will respond with the details of the newly created assignment instance, encapsulated within a JSON object.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
