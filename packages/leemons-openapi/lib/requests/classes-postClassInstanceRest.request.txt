  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'postClassInstanceRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio/backend/services/rest/class.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Create an instance of a class within the academic portfolio\",\"description\":\"This endpoint handles the creation of a new class instance within the academic portfolio management system. It typically involves specifying details such as the class name, associated course, and instructor details. This creation process is integral to maintaining an up-to-date academic structure in educational or institutional settings.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to create a class instance. Only logged-in users can initiate the creation process, ensuring secure and authorized access.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Creation of a class instance requires specific permissions, generally reserved for administrative or educational personnel. These permissions ensure that only authorized users can add new classes to the academic portfolio.\\n\\nThe endpoint initiates by processing the provided input which includes necessary details about the class through the `addClassInstance` method. This method validates the input against predefined criteria to ensure compliance with the academic standards and structure. After validation, it proceeds to add the new class instance to the database, handling any constraints or relations inherent in the academic model, such as linking the class to a specific course and assigning an instructor. The response from the endpoint confirms the successful creation of the class instance with relevant details or provides error messages in case of issues during the creation process.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
