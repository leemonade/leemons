  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'deleteDocumentRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-content-creator/backend/services/rest/document.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Delete a specified document\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for deleting a specific document identified by its unique ID. The operation entails removing the document from the database and ensuring that all associated data such as references or shared links are also appropriately handled.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to execute this deletion. The process checks for a valid user session and compares the user's identity against the ownership or permission attributes of the document to be deleted.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have administrative or specific rights over the document to execute a deletion. Permissions checks are implemented to ensure that only authorized users can delete documents.\\n\\nThe flow initiates when the `deleteDocument` action is called in the `document.rest.js` service file. This service then interacts with the `deleteDocument` core method defined in `deleteDocument.js`. The core method handles the logic for checking permissions, verifying document existence, and executing the delete operation in the database. Detailed error handling is implemented to manage cases like non-existent documents or insufficient permissions, ensuring the client receives clear and explanatory feedback. The method concludes by sending a response back to the client confirming the deletion or reporting any issues that occurred during the process.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
