  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'deleteRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-timetable/backend/services/rest/config.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Delete timetable configuration data\",\"description\":\"This endpoint allows for the deletion of specific timetable configuration data. It is typically used to remove obsolete or erroneous configuration entries that are no longer required in the system.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory to ensure that only authorized personnel can delete configuration data. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in access being denied.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have administrative permissions specifically for timetable configurations management. Without sufficient permissions, the request will be rejected.\\n\\nThe deletion process begins with the 'deleteRest' action which interfaces with the corresponding service method in the backend. This method performs a lookup to ensure that the configuration to be deleted exists and that the requesting user has the necessary permissions to proceed with the deletion. If these conditions are met, the configuration data is removed from the database. The flow involves error handling to manage any issues that might arise during the deletion process, such as missing data or database errors. On successful deletion, a confirmation response is sent back to the user, indicating that the data was successfully removed.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
