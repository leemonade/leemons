  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'listRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-board-messages/backend/services/rest/messages.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"List all board messages accessible to the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint enables the retrieval of all board messages that the current user has permissions to access. It is designed to facilitate communication within groups or boards by displaying relevant messages.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to view the messages. This ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive or private communications within their groups or boards.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have the appropriate permissions to view messages in specific boards. Access will be denied if the user does not have the necessary rights to the board or group messages they are attempting to access.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint initially calls the `list` method from the `messages` core, which invokes the `getMessageIdsByFilters` method to filter message IDs based on user permissions and other applied filters. Subsequently, `byIds` aggregates these IDs to retrieve detailed message data. The flow completes with the assembly of all relevant message information into a consumable format for the client, effectively responding with a structured list of messages available to the user under the established permissions.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
