  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'todayQuoteRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-users/backend/services/rest/init.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Provides the quote of the day for the user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint serves the purpose of offering a motivational or inspirational 'Quote of the Day' to the user. These quotes may vary daily and can be specific to user's interests if set in the user's profile preferences.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to access this feature. Unauthorized access attempts will be blocked and logged for security reasons.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users must have the 'read_quotes' permission enabled in their account settings to view the daily quote. Without this permission, access to the daily quote will not be granted.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request at this endpoint, the backend service first verifies the user's credentials and checks for the necessary permissions ('read_quotes'). If the authentication and permissions validation are successful, the service then proceeds to fetch the 'Quote of the Day' from a dedicated quotes management module integrated within the system. This module selects a quote based on the date and optionally the user's personal preferences stored in the user profile. The response, containing the quote, is then formulated in JSON format and sent back to the client, ensuring that each interaction is tailored and secure.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
