  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'countRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-timetable/backend/services/rest/timetable.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Counts the number of timetables based on provided filters\",\"description\":\"This endpoint provides the count of timetables that match certain criteria specified through filters. It essentially serves to inform the client about the quantity of timetables, facilitating operations like pagination in the user interface.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory for accessing this endpoint. Without a valid user session, the request will be rejected.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This endpoint requires the user to have `view_timetable` permission to proceed with fetching the count of timetables. Users without sufficient permissions will receive an access denial response.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint triggers the `countTimetables` action from the `TimetableService`. This action utilizes the `timeFiltersQuery` function from the helpers to generate a query based on the input parameters, which are assumed to include date ranges and possibly other constraints pertaining to timetables. The query is then executed in the database through the `count.js` method in the core module, which efficiently counts the entries matching the criteria without retrieving the full data sets. The result, a numerical value indicating the count of timetables, is then returned to the client in a straightforward JSON format.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
