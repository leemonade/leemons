Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

Authorized users can request the removal of specific scores identified by their unique identifiers. The operation ensures that only permissible records are deleted based on user rights and provided identifiers.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to issue deletion commands for score records. Unauthenticated requests will be rejected, ensuring that only valid users can perform deletions.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have the 'delete_scores' permission assigned to their role. Without this permission, the attempt to delete scores will be denied, ensuring system-wide integrity and access control are maintained.\\n\\nUpon receiving a delete request, the 'removeScores' handler in the 'scores.rest.js' service invokes the 'remove' method from the 'ScoresService'. The method uses parameters passed in the request to identify and validate the scores that should be deleted. It checks for user permissions and the existence of the scores in the database. If the validations pass, it proceeds to remove the scores. The process involves database operations to securely delete the records and then confirm the success of the operation to the user through an appropriate HTTP response.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
