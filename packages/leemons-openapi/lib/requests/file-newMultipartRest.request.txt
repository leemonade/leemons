  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'newMultipartRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-leebrary/backend/services/rest/files.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Handle multipart file upload and initialization process\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is designed to handle the multipart file uploading and initialization process. It receives a file from the user and initiates a set of operations to securely store and register the file in the system's storage infrastructure.\\n\\n**Authentication:** All users must be authenticated to upload files. A secure session or valid authentication token is required to ensure that the request originates from a legitimate source.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need the 'upload_file' permission to perform file uploads. This ensures that only users with the appropriate rights can upload files, maintaining system integrity and security.\\n\\nThe process begins in the `newMultipartRest` action, which calls the `newMultipart` method in the `Files` core. This method orchestrates various tasks such as validating file types, preparing file storage, and interacting with different file storage providers. It delegates specific responsibilities to sub-methods like `handleCreateFile`, `handleFileProvider`, and `handleFileSystem`. These sub-methods manage detailed aspects of file storage, such as creating file database entries, selecting appropriate storage providers based on the configuration, and physically storing the files on disk or cloud storage. The result of this orchestrated process is a JSON object response containing details about the newly uploaded file including its access paths, metadata, and status.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
