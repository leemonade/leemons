Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It aims to provide a structured overview useful for administrative purposes or user management interfaces.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Access to this endpoint requires the user to be logged in to the system. Any unauthorized access attempts will be rejected.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This endpoint requires the user to have administrative privileges or specific rights that allow the viewing of user profiles across the platform.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint initially ensures that the user is authenticated and authorized to access the data. This verification involves checking the user's authentication token and confirming that they have the necessary permissions. If authentication or authorization fails, the request is immediately rejected. Once verified, the endpoint calls the `listProfiles` method from the `Profiles` core. This method interacts with the database to retrieve all the profiles stored within it. Each profile is collected and formatted suitably before being sent back to the requester. The final output is delivered as a JSON array of profiles, each containing relevant details such as user IDs, names, and associated roles or permissions.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
