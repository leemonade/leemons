  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'finishMultipartRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-leebrary/backend/services/rest/files.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Completes the multipart file upload process\",\"description\":\"This endpoint finalizes the multipart upload sequence for a file that has been uploaded in chunks. It assimilates all parts of the file that have been uploaded separately, constructs the final complete file, and makes it available for use or download.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to finalize multipart uploads. A valid session or token is required to prove the user's identity and ensure that the action is securely controlled.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Specific permissions are necessary for a user to complete a multipart upload. Typically, the user needs write or upload permissions on the destination where the file is being saved. This ensures that the user has the right to complete uploads to the specified directory or system.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request to finalize a multipart upload, the `finishMultipart` method in the file service is called. This method checks for all parts of the file stored temporarily during the upload process, verifies their integrity, and concatenates them into a single file. This process may involve validation of each part's checksums to ensure no data corruption occurred during transmission. Once verified and combined, the file is then processed for any needed metadata extraction or further validation based on the file type and service configuration. On successful completion, the concatenated file is made permanently available at its destination, and appropriate metadata is updated to reflect the new file's attributes.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
