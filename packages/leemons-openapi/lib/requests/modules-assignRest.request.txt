  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'assignRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-learning-paths/backend/services/rest/modules.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Assign a learning module to a specific user or group\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for assigning a learning module from the learning paths system to a user or a group of users. It allows administrators or authorized personnel to dynamically allocate educational content to different learners based on requirements or learning paths.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory to access this endpoint. Users are required to provide a valid authentication token to prove their identity and access rights before making requests to this endpoint.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need to have 'manage_learning_paths' permission to assign modules. Without the necessary permissions, the request will be rejected, ensuring that only authorized users can assign learning modules.\\n\\nThe controller starts by validating the user's authentication status and permissions. Upon successful validation, it invokes the `assignModule` function from the `modules` core logic. This function takes parameters such as module ID and user or group ID, and then interacts with the database to update the module assignments. The process involves checking the module's availability, the user's or group's eligibility, and then updating the assignment records in the database. The outcome of the operation is sent back to the user in the form of a success or error message, detailing the result of the assignment attempt.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
