  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'setQuestionResponseRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-feedback/backend/services/rest/feedback.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Records a user's response to feedback-related questions\",\"description\":\"This endpoint allows for the recording and updating of a user's responses to specific feedback questions presented within the platform. It provides a critical interaction within the user feedback loop, capturing valuable insights from users about various aspects of product or service usability, satisfaction, and overall experience.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to submit their responses. The authentication verifies user identity and ensures that responses are correctly attributed to the user's account.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have the 'feedback-response:create' permission to post new responses and 'feedback-response:edit' to update their existing responses. These permissions ensure that only authorized users can interact with feedback mechanisms accordingly.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint firstly checks the user's authentication status and permissions. If these checks are passed, the `setQuestionResponse` service method is invoked with parameters that identify the specific question and capture the userâ€™s response. This method handles the intricate details of storing or updating the response data in the database. The process includes validation of the input data to comply with expected formats and constraints. Finally, an appropriate response is generated and sent back to the client, indicating the success or failure of the operation.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
