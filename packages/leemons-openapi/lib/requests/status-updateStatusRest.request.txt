Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

It changes the state of user progress and interaction with the SCORM content to reflect recent activities or completion status.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to access and modify SCORM package status. Users must be logged in with valid credentials to successfully call this endpoint.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This endpoint requires that the user has permissions to modify SCORM package statuses, typically granted to educators or administrators who manage e-learning content and tracking.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the `updateStatusRest` handler invokes the `updateStatus` method in the `status` core service. This method performs several operations: it first validates the user's identity and permissions to ensure they are authorized to update SCORM statuses. It then processes the input data to adjust the relevant user's SCORM status in the database. This process includes error handling to manage possible exceptions such as invalid input or database errors. Finally, the response is formulated to indicate the success or failure of the update operation, along with appropriate status codes.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
