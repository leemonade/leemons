  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'listMultipleSubjectsClassesRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio/backend/services/rest/class.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"List multiple subject classes based on specified criteria\",\"description\":\"This endpoint provides a detailed list of subject classes based on the specified criteria. It is designed to help users efficiently retrieve information about different classes within various subjects as a consolidated response. This can include classes across different departments or faculties, filtered according to the input parameters, which are encapsulated within the request.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to request this information. Access to the endpoint requires the user to provide valid authentication credentials, which will be verified prior to data retrieval.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Specific permissions are required to access this endpoint. Users must have the 'view_classes' permission assigned to their role. Without this permission, the endpoint will deny access to the requested information.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the 'listMultipleSubjectsClassesRest' handler initiates by extracting and validating the input parameters from the request. It then invokes the 'listSubjectClasses' method from the academic portfolio's backend services, passing along necessary criteria for class filtration. This method interacts with the database to retrieve data about subject classes that match the given parameters. The process encapsulates error handling to ensure that any issues during data retrieval are managed, resulting in either a successful response with the data or an error message detailing the failure. The final response to the client is formatted as a JSON array containing the details about the classes, structured according to the specified requirements of the client-side application.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
