  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'putCycleRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-academic-portfolio/backend/services/rest/cycle.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

The endpoint facilitates the modification of cycle attributes such as start date, end date, and associated programs or courses.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to update an academic cycle. Access to this functionality might be allowed only through secure and verified login sessions.\\n\\n**Permissions:** This functionality requires the user to have administrative rights over academic cycle management. Typically, this would include roles like Academic Administrator or System Administrator who has privileges to modify academic entities.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint first verifies user authentication and permissions. If valid, it then proceeds to invoke the `updateCycle` function from the `Cycle` core module. This function is responsible for checking the existence of the cycle and applying the updates if valid parameters are provided. Error handling mechanisms are employed to manage cases where the cycle does not exist or invalid data is provided. The response communicates the status of the operation along with any pertinent updated cycle information or error messages.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
