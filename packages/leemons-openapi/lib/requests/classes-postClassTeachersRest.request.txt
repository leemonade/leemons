Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

This operation is crucial for managing class responsibilities and access for teachers in the educational management system.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to access and modify the teachers' assignments for classes. An improper or missing authentication will prevent access to this endpoint.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user needs to have administrative rights or specific role-based permissions that allow them to manage teacher assignments within classes. These permissions are necessary to ensure that only authorized personnel can make changes to the academic assignments.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the endpoint first validates the user's authentication and authorization levels. Post validation, it invokes methods from the `Classes` service, particularly `addMultipleTeachersToClass`, which accepts class ID and teacher IDs. This service then interacts with the underlying database to update the class records by associating them with the specified teacher IDs. The process involves checks and balances to ensure that the data integrity is maintained throughout the transaction. Finally, a successful operation will confirm the updated associations via a response, detailing the newly created links between the specified class and its teachers.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
