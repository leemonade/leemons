  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'getProvidersRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-admin/backend/services/rest/mail.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Lists all available mail service providers\",\"description\":\"This endpoint fetches and lists all the mail service providers configured in the system. It allows the user to view various third-party providers that can be integrated for sending emails from the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users need to be authenticated to access this endpoint to ensure that only authorized users can view the available mail service providers.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users must have the 'admin' role or specific permission to view mail service providers. Unauthorized access attempts will be logged and denied.\\n\\nThe function begins by validating user authentication and permissions. Once validated, the handler invokes a service method to retrieve all configured mail service providers from the system's configuration. This method checks the internal service registry for available providers, gathers their details (like provider name, configuration settings, and status), and then returns them in a structured list. This list is finally sent back to the client as a JSON response, providing a clear and concise overview of the mail service options available for use within the platform.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
