  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'setRest' property does in the '/Users/usuario/Sites/leemonade/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-scores/backend/services/rest/weights.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Set weight configuration for student assessments\",\"description\":\"This endpoint sets or updates the weights associated with different components of student assessments within a given context. Weights determine how various elements contribute to the final calculation of a student's score.\\n\\n**Authentication:** User authentication is required to access this endpoint. Unauthenticated requests will be rejected, ensuring that only authorized users can manage weight configurations.\\n\\n**Permissions:** The user must have administrative privileges or specific permissions related to score management. Without the necessary permissions, the request will be denied, maintaining strict access control to sensitive operations.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, this endpoint first validates the input data using the `validateWeight.js` validator to ensure all provided values are correct and adhere to required formats. If validation fails, the endpoint immediately returns an error response. If validation is successful, the `setWeight.js` method in the `weights` core is called with the passed data. This method handles the logic of adding or updating weight entries in the database, ensuring data integrity and applying any required business logic. On successful completion, the endpoint returns a success message, and in cases of failure, it provides a detailed error message to help diagnose the issue.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
