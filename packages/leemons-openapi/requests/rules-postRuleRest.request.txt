  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'postRuleRest' property does in the '/Users/rvillares/Desktop/workdir/leemonade/leemons-saas/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-grades/backend/services/rest/rules.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Create or update grading rules\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for adding or updating rules used for grading within the system. It facilitates the creation of new grading criteria or the modification of existing ones to reflect changes in grading policies or procedures.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to modify grading rules. Only requests from authenticated sessions will be processed, while unauthenticated requests will be rejected.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users must have the appropriate permissions to create or update grading rules. The action requires administrative level permissions, or specific roles granted the capability to manage academic grading configurations.\\n\\nUpon receiving a request, the `postRuleRest` handler begins the process by validating input parameters against predefined schemas to ensure all required rule data is present and correctly formatted. It then proceeds to call the `addRule` method from the `rules` core, passing in the rule data. This method is responsible for either inserting a new rule into the database or updating an existing one if an identifier is provided. The method involves complex business logic, including evaluating conditions and manipulating condition groups associated with the rules. After the operation is successful, the endpoint returns a status code indicating the creation or update of the rule along with any relevant rule details in the response body.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
