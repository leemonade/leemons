  "systemMessage": "Respond as if you were an expert in REST APIs for JavaScript using the Moleculer framework.Return a valid JSON object with only 'summary' and 'description' properties that can be used to document, using OpenAPI specifications, what the handler of the 'postDependencyRest' property does in the '/Users/rvillares/Desktop/workdir/leemonade/leemons-saas/leemons/plugins/leemons-plugin-grades/backend/services/rest/dependency.rest.js' file, which is an action in the Moleculer JavaScript framework.\nI want 'summary' only have a short resume of what the controller does. Don't start it with \"This handler\" or \"This Endpoint\", only the summary.\nI want the description to be in markdown format and contain the following information (each point should be clearly separated into a different paragraph):\n* Short detailed description of what the handler does. It should always start with \"This endpoint\" and should not contain information about the parameters it receives and the response it returns, only what is expected to be done.\n* Authentication: Information about whether the user needs to be logged in to use the endpoint. It should start with '**Authentication:**\"\n* Permissions: Information about the permissions required for the user to use the endpoint. It should start with \"**Permissions:**\"\n* Fully detailed description of what the controller handler, and the methods the controller flow from request to response, does.\nYou can use this response as example: '{\"summary\":\"Retrieve assets owned by the current user\",\"description\":\"This endpoint retrieves all digital assets that are owned by the currently authenticated user. The collection of assets returned includes those that the user has created or have been shared with them within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** The users must be authenticated to access their digital assets. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.\\n\\n**Permissions:** No specific permissions are called out for this endpoint; however, it's implied that users can only access assets that they have rights to view based on the asset's ownership and sharing properties.\\n\\nThe endpoint starts by invoking the `getByUser` method from the `Pins` core, passing in the `ctx` (context) parameter which includes user authentication information. This method leverages a database call to find all pins associated with the user's agent ID. These pins represent the user's digital assets within the platform. The result is a promise that, when resolved, returns the list of assets that the authenticated user owns or has access to. The HTTP response contains these assets in a JSON array format.\"}'\n",

  "response": "{\"summary\":\"Manage grading dependencies\",\"description\":\"This endpoint is responsible for creating or updating dependencies related to the grading system within the application. Dependencies may include, but are not limited to, associations between various grading rules, condition groups, and conditions that together define the logic for grading within the platform.\\n\\n**Authentication:** Users must be authenticated to modify the grading dependencies. Unauthenticated requests will be rejected and the user will be prompted to log in.\\n\\n**Permissions:** Users need to have adequate permission levels, typically administrative rights, to manage grading dependencies. Without the proper permissions, the request will be denied.\\n\\nUpon receipt of the request, the `postDependencyRest` action is invoked which then delegates the task to an internal method, perhaps labeled `createOrUpdateDependency`. This method would handle the validation of input data (using schemas defined in `validations/forms.js`) and orchestrate the creation or update process by calling other service methods such as `addRule` from `core/rules/addRule.js`, `addConditionGroup` from `core/condition-groups/addConditionGroup.js`, and `addCondition` from `core/conditions/addCondition.js`. The service methods collaborate to ensure dependencies are set up or modified correctly, taking into account any pre-existing rules, condition groups, and conditions fetched from database operations through methods like `ruleByIds`, `getRuleConditionsByRuleIds`, `getConditionsByRule`, and `getConditionGroupsByRule`. The result is then formatted and sent back as a response to the client, indicating the successful handling of grading dependencies.\",\"AIGenerated\":true}"
