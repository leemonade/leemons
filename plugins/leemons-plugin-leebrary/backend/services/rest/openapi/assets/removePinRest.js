  summary: "Remove a pinned asset from the user's collection",
  description: `This endpoint allows a user to unpin or remove an asset previously marked as important or distinctive in their collection. The function alters the user's pinned asset list by removing a specified asset, thus updating the user's preferences and collection views.

**Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory to ensure that the request to unpin an asset originates from a bona fide source. An invalid or expired authentication token will prevent access to this functionality.

**Permissions:** This endpoint requires that users have proper rights to modify their own pinned assets. The specific permission \`unpin_asset\` should be validated to permit the operation which ensures the integrity and security of user data.

Upon receiving a request, the \`removePinRest\` endpoint first verifies user authentication and permissions. It then proceeds to call the \`unpinAsset\` method within the service logic where the actual unpinning procedure is executed. This method checks the provided asset identifier against the userâ€™s currently pinned assets, and if found, it is removed from the pinned list. The entire process is encapsulated within a transaction to ensure data consistency. Should the operation succeed, a success response is sent back to the user; in case of failure due to reasons such as non-existent asset ID or insufficient permissions, the appropriate error message is returned.`,
