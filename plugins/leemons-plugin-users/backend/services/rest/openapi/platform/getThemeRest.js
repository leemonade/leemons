  description: `This endpoint retrieves the theme settings currently active for the platform. It provides the appearance configurations that dictate the visual aspects of the platformâ€™s user interface.

**Authentication:** The user must be authenticated to access the theme settings. An invalid or missing authentication token will result in endpoint access denial.

**Permissions:** The user needs to have administrative permissions to access the theme settings. Without the required permissions, the endpoint will deny access to the theme configurations.

Once invoked, the \`getTheme\` handler in the backend service begins by confirming user authentication and checks for administrative permissions. If these checks pass, it then calls the \`getTheme\` method from the \`Platform\` core. This method accesses the database to retrieve the current theme settings applied to the platform. The results are then formatted and sent back as a JSON object representing the theme settings, ensuring that the administrator can view or modify the visual configurations as needed.`,
