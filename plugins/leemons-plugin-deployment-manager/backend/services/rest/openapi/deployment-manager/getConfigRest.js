  summary: 'Fetch deployment configuration details',
  description: `This endpoint retrieves the configuration details associated with a specific deployment. This encompasses fetching relevant configuration items such as environment settings, deployment scripts, and associated metadata that define how a deployment should be conducted within the system.

**Authentication:** Users are required to be authenticated to ensure secure access to deployment configuration details. Authentication mechanisms must validate the userâ€™s identity before allowing access to this endpoint.

**Permissions:** Appropriate permissions must be verified before a user can retrieve deployment configuration details. Typically, users need to have 'deployment-manager' or 'administrator' roles to access this configuration information.

Behind the scenes, this endpoint invokes the \`getDeploymentConfig\` action within the deployment-manager service. It initiates a process to load and return detailed configuration parameters specific to a given deployment. This involves parsing configuration files or accessing a database where these details are stored, ensuring that all returned data respects current operational and security policies. The final response includes a structured JSON object that encapsulates all necessary deployment settings.`,
