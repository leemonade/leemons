  summary: 'Determine if a program contains any substages',
  description: `This endpoint checks if a specific academic program contains any substages or not. The primary operation of this endpoint is to ascertain the substage structure within a particular program, which is crucial for managing educational program layouts.

**Authentication:** User authentication is mandatory to access this endpoint. Users must provide valid session credentials to proceed with querying the academic program substages.

**Permissions:** Appropriate permissions are required to access this endpoint. Users should possess the 'view_programs' permission or similar rights that allow them to interact with academic program data.

Upon receiving a request, the handler \`programHasSubstagesRest\` calls the \`getProgramSubstages\` method in the \`programs\` core. This method fetches the program details based on the provided program ID and evaluates whether there are any associated substages. The flow includes validating the userâ€™s credentials and permissions, retrieving the program data from the database, and analyzing the presence of substages. The result, indicating either the existence or absence of substages, is then returned as a Boolean value to the client.`,
